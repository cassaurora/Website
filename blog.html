      <h2>Growing up in Northwestern Ontario, I spent much of my summers at camp. Most camps had sauna's since there happens to be a large settler Finnish community back home. Sauna's became part of a quintessential summer experience. Much like the Fins, many other Indigenous cultures around the world have their own version of the sauna, including First Nations in the form of a Sweatlodge. </h2>

      <h2>To me, sauna experiences represent a form of ceremony.<h2>

      <h2>So, since moving to Whistler, B.C. I was missing both experiences. Which ultimately led me to a program led by Whistler Centre for Sustainability.
      In November 2019, I was announced as the winner of the <a href="https://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/whistler/whistlers-cass-spence-named-inaugural-winner-of-indigenous-tourism-startup-programs-pitch-event/Content?oid=14777013" target="_blank">Tourism Start-Up!</a> Since then, I have embarked on launching a Mobile Barrel Sauna Rental business.<h2>

      <h2> Sauna's are safe, shared spaces which embody natural wellness and community. An opportunity to disconnect from devices and connect within or with friends and family. A chance to integrate fire and water surrounded in sacred cedar. </h2>

      <h2>Our Indigenous designed saunas plan to offer a luxury "wellness on wheels" service available in Whistler BC, a year-round destination resort bringing exclusive relaxation surrounded by nature and mountains.</h2>


      <h2>In a mountain town that hosts over 3 million guests per year, guests can discover an opportunity to engage in self-care, while being able to socialize and have the flexibility to take time utilizing wellness services either solo or with friends or family of their choice anytime year-round.<h2>

      <h2>There are many health benefits of saunas including improved cardiovascular performance, aid in sports recovery, flush toxins, reduces incidences of Alzheimer's by 65%, induces improved deeper sleep, burns calories and relieves stress.</h2>

      <h2>Tourists, including event planners, those involved in adventure sports and mountain enthusiasts, who are looking for rejuvenation and authentic experiences in Whistler can rent a traditional wood-burning or infrared 10 person sauna. Rentals include convenient and hassle-free delivery and pick-up services.
      Each sauna is muraled in authentic Indigenous art stationed on a trailer and equipped with complimentary towels, bathrobes and Indigenous aroma therapies. An experience guests can have again and again.</h2>

      <h2>Miigwetch, Thank you!</h2>
