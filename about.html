      <h2>
        Steller Jay Sauna's is owned by Cass S who is a Cree Womxn from Northwestern Ontario now living in Whistler B.C. since 2014. Traditional name is Wawatay which translates to Northern Lights in the Anishinawbe language.</h2>

      <h2>Her passion for Indigenous wellness and sustainable tourism ignited Stellar Jay Saunas. Her entrepreneurship honours her Grandmother who was a residential school survivor and her Mother who is a 60's scoop survivor - their legacy of resilience has allowed her to be where she is today.</h2>

        <h2>Cass believes Indigenous sauna units represent more than just a service offered to guests - it is a showcase of Indigenous wellness and re-connection to the land, bringing the spirit back into sacred spaces, sustainably.</h2>

      <h2>Miigwetch!</h2>
